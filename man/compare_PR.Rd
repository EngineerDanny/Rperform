The function must be called from a directory containing only a single git
repository checked out to the branch which is meant to be tested against the

Given a test-file path and the required metric, it returns the metric details
of the file against the first commit till the latest common commit for the
git repo, and against the latest commit for master branch of the repo's
remote. It also returns information regarding the latest common commit for
the two directories.
