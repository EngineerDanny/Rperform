\title{Memory metrics across branches.}
\usage{
compare_branchm(test_path, branch1, branch2 = "master")
}
\arguments{
\item{test_path}{File-path for the test file to be tested.}

\item{branch1}{Branch against whose commits the test file is to be 
tested.}

\item{branch2}{Branch into which branch1 is supposedly to be merged.}
}
\description{
Given a test-file and two branches, returns the memory metrics of the file

leaked and maximum memory utilized during its execution.
}
\section{Value}{

compare_branchm returns an object of class "data.frame".
The data-frame consists of the following columns:
\code{test_name}
\code{metric_name}
\code{status}
\code{metric_val}
\code{message}
\code{date_time}
\code{time_branch}
}

\section{Warning}{

  Function assumes the current directory to be the root directory of the
  package being tested.
}

\examples{

\dontrun{
# Set the current directory to the git repository concerned.
setwd("./Path/to/repository")

# Set the file-path
t_path <- "Path/to/file"

# Load the library and pass the parameters to the function
library(Rperform)
compare_branchm(test_path = t_path, branch1 = "helper", branch2 = "master")
}
